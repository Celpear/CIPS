# CIPS
## 100% decentralized, serverless and encrypted smart home!

Celpear Indoor Positioning System (CIPS) is a technology to track objects in rooms. This means that smart devices such as robotic vacuum cleaners no longer need expensive position sensors. CIPS enables a local API in which clients can obtain their global position in the room. It also allows lost devices to be found.

Decentralized control allows you to access your devices securely from anywhere in the world. And it's completely free of charge. Your data remains your data. Without having to rely on cloud servers.

Your Smarthome, which runs all day, also supports the network without significantly increased power costs.


# How it works:
CIPS allows you to have an open API on your home network. Companies can use this for their products and thus be controlled serverless.

The API also includes the location of your devices within your home. For this purpose, the exact position is calculated and made available. This way, vacuum robots or security drones can navigate autonomously in your home.
